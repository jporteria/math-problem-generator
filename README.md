# Math Problem Generator - Developer Assessment Starter Kit

## Overview

This is a starter kit for building an AI-powered math problem generator application. The goal is to create a standalone prototype that uses AI to generate math word problems suitable for Primary 5 students, saves the problems and user submissions to a database, and provides personalized feedback.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Supabase
- **AI Integration**: Google Generative AI (Gemini)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd math-problem-generator
```

### 2. Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a free account
2. Create a new project
3. Go to Settings â†’ API to find your:
   - Project URL (starts with `https://`)
   - Anon/Public Key

### 3. Set Up Database Tables

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of `database.sql`
3. Click "Run" to create the tables and policies

### 4. Get Google API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key for Gemini

### 5. Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```
2. Edit `.env.local` and add your actual keys:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_actual_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_supabase_anon_key
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_google_api_key
   ```

### 6. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 7. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Your Task

### 1. Implement Frontend Logic (`app/page.tsx`)

Complete the TODO sections in the main page component:

- **generateProblem**: Call your API route to generate a new math problem
- **submitAnswer**: Submit the user's answer and get feedback

### 2. Create Backend API Route (`app/api/math-problem/route.ts`)

Create a new API route that handles:

#### POST /api/math-problem (Generate Problem)

- Use Google's Gemini AI to generate a math word problem
- The AI should return JSON with:
  ```json
  {
    "problem_text": "A bakery sold 45 cupcakes...",
    "final_answer": 15
  }
  ```
- Save the problem to `math_problem_sessions` table
- Return the problem and session ID to the frontend

#### POST /api/math-problem/submit (Submit Answer)

- Receive the session ID and user's answer
- Check if the answer is correct
- Use AI to generate personalized feedback based on:
  - The original problem
  - The correct answer
  - The user's answer
  - Whether they got it right or wrong
- Save the submission to `math_problem_submissions` table
- Return the feedback and correctness to the frontend

### 3. Requirements Checklist

- [x] AI generates appropriate Primary 5 level math problems
- [x] Problems and answers are saved to Supabase
- [x] User submissions are saved with feedback
- [x] AI generates helpful, personalized feedback
- [x] UI is clean and mobile-responsive
- [x] Error handling for API failures
- [x] Loading states during API calls

## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and import your repository
3. Add your environment variables in Vercel's project settings
4. Deploy!

## Assessment Submission

When submitting your assessment, provide:

1. **GitHub Repository URL**: Make sure it's public
2. **Live Demo URL**: Your Vercel deployment
3. **Supabase Credentials**: Add these to your README for testing:
   ```
   SUPABASE_URL: https://aomfokcumnzpdqlcbrfr.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImFvbWZva2N1bW56cGRxbGNicmZyIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTk4MTIwNDEsImV4cCI6MjA3NTM4ODA0MX0.4PMJMxnTaRVoAsgzolXUWB_ZuCAU2vwcFKEYMUWvsBc
   ```

## Implementation Notes

Throughout this project, I encountered several technical challenges that provided valuable learning experiences. The most significant hurdle was with AI integration, where I discovered that my Google API key configuration only accepted the gemini-2.5-flash model specifically, which took considerable debugging time to identify since the error messages weren't immediately clear about the model compatibility requirements. Additionally, I faced Tailwind CSS configuration issues where the application's styling wasn't rendering properly due to conflicting custom CSS in the globals.css file that was overriding Tailwind utilities. Resolving this required removing the custom body styles and converting the PostCSS configuration from ES modules to CommonJS format to ensure proper processing.

### My Implementation:

- **Frontend Logic**: Fully implemented with proper state management, loading states for both problem generation and answer submission, comprehensive error handling, and clean UI with Tailwind CSS
- **AI Integration**: Integrated Google Gemini 2.5 Flash API for both problem generation and personalized feedback generation, with fallback mechanisms when AI is unavailable
- **Database Operations**: Complete Supabase integration with proper table structure, saving both problem sessions and user submissions with feedback
- **API Routes**:
  - `POST /api/math-problem` - Generates new problems using AI and saves to database
  - `POST /api/math-problem/submit` - Evaluates answers and generates personalized feedback
- **Code Quality**: Added comprehensive comments, proper TypeScript interfaces, separated loading states, and clean code organization
- **UI/UX**: Responsive design with loading spinners, visual feedback for correct/incorrect answers, proper form validation, and smooth transitions
