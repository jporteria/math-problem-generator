## Implementation Notes

Throughout this project, I encountered several technical challenges that provided valuable learning experiences. The most significant hurdle was with AI integration, where I discovered that my Google API key configuration only accepted the gemini-2.5-flash model specifically, which took considerable debugging time to identify since the error messages weren't immediately clear about the model compatibility requirements. Additionally, I faced Tailwind CSS configuration issues where the application's styling wasn't rendering properly due to conflicting custom CSS in the globals.css file that was overriding Tailwind utilities. Resolving this required removing the custom body styles and converting the PostCSS configuration from ES modules to CommonJS format to ensure proper processing.

Later in development, I encountered JSON parsing issues with Gemini's responses that were wrapped in markdown code blocks, requiring sophisticated parsing logic to extract the actual JSON data. The final optimization phase involved comprehensive code cleanup, removing unused functions, API routes, and debug statements to create a production-ready codebase.

### My Implementation:

- **Frontend Logic**: Fully implemented with proper state management, loading states for both problem generation and answer submission, comprehensive error handling, and clean UI with Tailwind CSS
- **AI Integration**: Integrated Google Gemini 2.5 Flash API for comprehensive math education features including problem generation with pre-generated hints, personalized feedback, and detailed step-by-step solution explanations, with robust fallback mechanisms when AI is unavailable
- **Database Operations**: Complete Supabase integration with optimized table structure, saving problem sessions with hints, user submissions with feedback, and score tracking for leaderboard functionality
- **API Routes**:
  - `POST /api/math-problem` - Generates new problems with hints using AI and saves to database
  - `POST /api/math-problem/submit` - Evaluates answers and generates personalized feedback
  - `GET /api/high-scores` - Retrieves top 3 scores for leaderboard display
  - `GET /api/problem-history` - Fetches user's recent problem attempts and results
  - `POST /api/solution` - Generates detailed step-by-step solution explanations (only after user attempts)
- **Code Quality**: Added comprehensive comments, proper TypeScript interfaces, separated loading states, clean code organization, and removed all unused functions and debug logs for production-ready code
- **UI/UX**: Fully responsive design with loading spinners, visual feedback for correct/incorrect answers, proper form validation, smooth transitions, and real-time score tracking. Features a modern dashboard with time-based greetings, platform features showcase, and top 3 high scores leaderboard with medal rankings
- **Problem Types**: Implemented dynamic problem type selection (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Mixed) with AI prompt customization for each type, allowing users to focus on specific math operations or practice all types randomly
- **Dashboard**: Created a comprehensive landing page featuring time-based greetings (Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening), platform features overview, top 3 high scores leaderboard with medal rankings, and smooth navigation to quiz functionality
- **Learning Support**: 
  - **Instant Hints**: Pre-generated hints stored in database for immediate access without AI delays
  - **Step-by-Step Solutions**: AI-powered detailed explanations that break down problems into clear, educational steps appropriate for Primary 5 students (only available after user attempts the problem)
  - **Smart Learning Flow**: Users must attempt problems before accessing solutions, encouraging independent thinking
