## My Implementation

- **Frontend Logic**: Fully implemented with proper state management, loading states for both problem generation and answer submission, comprehensive error handling, and clean UI with Tailwind CSS
- **AI Integration**: Integrated Google Gemini 2.5 Flash API for both problem generation and personalized feedback generation, with fallback mechanisms when AI is unavailable
- **Database Operations**: Complete Supabase integration with proper table structure, saving both problem sessions and user submissions with feedback
- **API Routes**: 
  - `POST /api/math-problem` - Generates new problems using AI and saves to database
  - `POST /api/math-problem/submit` - Evaluates answers and generates personalized feedback
- **Code Quality**: Added comprehensive comments, proper TypeScript interfaces, separated loading states, and clean code organization
- **UI/UX**: Responsive design with loading spinners, visual feedback for correct/incorrect answers, proper form validation, and smooth transitions
